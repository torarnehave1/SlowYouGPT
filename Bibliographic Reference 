### Enabling Semantic Search with MongoDB Atlas

#### Overview
The tutorial provided by MongoDB showcases how to enable semantic search on user-specific data, a process that includes loading, transforming, embedding, and storing data. The Lang chain team provides utilities to simplify this process.

#### Prerequisites
- MongoDB Atlas account
- OpenAI API key
- Python or JavaScript with Node.js

#### Steps for Semantic Search
1. **Clone the Repository**: A GitHub repository with the necessary code is provided, from which the viewer should clone the code.
2. **Configure API Keys**: Enter the OpenAI API key and MongoDB connection string in the provided `pam.py` file.
3. **Install Requirements**: Set up a Python environment, activate it, and install the requirements from the `requirements.txt` file.
4. **Data Vectorization**: Using the AT&T Wikipedia page as a data source, the tutorial explains the vectorization process: loading the data, transforming it into smaller chunks, embedding these chunks using an LLM like OpenAI's embeddings, and finally storing the vectors in MongoDB Atlas.
5. **Performing the Search**: After setting up a vector search index in MongoDB Atlas, you can perform a search using the provided `query.py` file.

#### Vector Database and MongoDB
MongoDB Atlas is highlighted as an ideal solution for storing vector embeddings. The Lang chain MongoDB Atlas module is showcased for its ability to handle the vectorization process seamlessly.

#### Querying Data
The tutorial concludes by demonstrating how to query the vectorized data using MongoDB's Vector search. It walks through a CLI-based query tool that vectorizes the search query and retrieves the relevant data.

#### Final Thoughts
The tutorial emphasizes the simplicity of implementing semantic search with MongoDB Atlas and Lang chain. It invites the audience to try MongoDB Vector search in AI projects and to provide feedback on their experience.
